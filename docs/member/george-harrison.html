          <h2>Guitar, vocals</h2>
          <p><Often known as the ‘Quiet Beatle’, George Harrison, the youngest of the Fab Four, served as the lead guitarist of the Beatles. He is known for his interest in mysticism and Eastern culture, which he infused into the group’s later works, and went on to an acclaimed career as a solo artist.</p>
<p>Harrison joined the Quarrymen in 1958 as a guitarist due to his friend Paul McCartney’s urging. As the group developed, Harrison’s interest in folk and soul music began to influence the band, with tracks like Love You To and Norwegian Wood (This Bird Has Flown) sporting a distinctive non-Western flavor.</p>
<p>By 1968, Harrison had grown tired of the band’s direction and sought to pursue a solo career. He felt stunted creatively by Lennon and McCartney, and briefly left the band during the Let It Be recording sessions. While few in comparison to Lennon and McCartney’s songs, Harrison is known for producing a few of their best songs in Here Comes The Sun, Something, and While My Guitar Gently Weeps.</p>
<p>Harrison embarked on a successful solo career where he could fully embrace his folky, spiritual interests, best displayed on his 1970 debut triple album All Things Must Pass. On it were classics such as My Sweet Lord, What Is Life, and If Not For You, and without any bias it is easily my favorite solo Beatle record.</p>
<p>Harrison passed away due to lung cancer on November 29, 2001 at the age of 58. His legacy is one of offbeat interests and he will stand forever as a pivotal member of the Beatles.</p>
